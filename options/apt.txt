            apt  Tracks packages that have been installed and removed to apt.
                 Intended to be used in containerized environments where the
                 volumes are preserved but containers are routinely destroyed
                 (e.g. using a newer image). If the volume is re-used in a new
                 container, the packages will be automatically re-installed.
